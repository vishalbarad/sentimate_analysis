  Few issues are resolved that are mention below..but still this mobile hasn't the charm of OnePlus..",3.0 out of 5 stars
"
  The best part of the phone is it's super simple and user friendly operating system. Camera doesn't oversaturate colours and captures decent photos. Battery charging is super fast. People argue that this is overpriced in this segment but I guess ease of using the phone and mainly the OS wouldn't be so good in other comparable phones. It is super light and handy. Cheers

  My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞

  So far, so good. While the omission of the alert slider is baffling, everything else seems good for the price. Oxygen OS and good service of OnePlus is the saving grace, else there are better specifications out there. Buy it if software performance is your number 1 priority. Else you can get better phones from Redmi, iQoo or others.

  I have one plus six purchase in 2018. It was working fine with no issue. I always have interest on 5 G phone and this was purchase during Amazon sell. The delivery was smooth in one day. The phone has transparent cover no need to purchase any cover. The wireless data , apps, contact transfer between two android phone is so smooth , one should always try while setting the new phone ( both phone should have wifi / SIM card. The phone is much lighter , fingerprint sensor working smooth, fast browsing,  the two specific feature I want to mention , one is battery back up ( more than one day ) and another is excellent picture quality which are the main attraction. I am having I phone 11, but the picture quality is far superior. The discount I received from HDFC as well as Amazon. You may try if you want a change of handset .The photo was taken today at 6.45 PM in cloudy sky and low light . You can see the quality and judge

  The smoothest phone I have used so far. I have used it for 2 days and I don't have any complaints on it so far.  I had used One Plus 2 for almost 5 and half years and then switched to Samsung phone, but I didn't like it. Was looking for a phone in a mid budget range, this is the best.

  First of all this phone has degraded quality based on processor, camera, charging etc compared to other OnePlus devices including OnePlus Nord. Selfie camera is just way too pathetic.takes too much time for charging .. in short its just like all other average android phones with big price tag!!! Not much speciality of OnePlus features. Over priced!

  I am a One plus Fan and was eagerly waiting for my Nord CE which I pre-ordered. I received it on 19th(thanks for the quick delivery Amazon).

   Worst product experience.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"
  So here is my review after 3 days of monitoring performance and overall experience. I am first time one plus user. Always wanted to try one plus . I am a samsung lover and also iphone user. For me comfort, ease and technologically advanced features matter the most. This phone is very well in all these aspects. I have medium to high usage. Call and texts throughout the day. Checking websites making notes, social media usage is high too. With my old phone samsung A50 I could get issue with battery by the time it is 7pm  to 8pm but with this phone it survives well till 12am too. Not sure if it is genuinely fast charging as haven't got a chance to charge in hurry or so.",5.0 out of 5 stars

  You should not buy this phone because it's literally waste of your money!! After using 3 days i have already started to get some issues , battery is fine and camera quality is too bad and night mode is even more worse !! See i am not having any personal issues , i just want others to not waste their money like me .

  This device is not even close to 12 gb ram.. I have OnePlus 3 as well which is still working and usable than this device. Camera is lagging, Apps crashing, touch issues, over heating. If you're a minimal user like calls, social networking and basics then buy it. Don't be under the impression that it is similar to rest of the OnePlus devices.

  This phone is a total disappointment. I had been using OnePlus 5T for over 3 years and the phone was working brilliantly with no flaws in performance whatsoever. Hence, decided to stick with the OnePlus brand and bought the Nord CE5G. However, this is nowhere close to my old phone and has multiple issues. Deleting of files on gallery takes forever, proximity sensor is faulty prompting you to mute yourself in between calls, jiotv doesn't work and the touch performance is below par. I would not recommend this phone to any existing OnePlus user!

  The entire phone rides on the Oxygen OS. I personally am an OnePlus fan boy and have been using OnePlus since OnePlus 3. I switched from my 3 year old OnePlus 6 to Nord CE and to me, it feels like an upgrade. Battery life is fantastic and you can look at this gorgeous display all day long. I am missing the alert slider since I have been used to it, otherwise everything works like a charm. Vibration motor feels extremely cheap, but I am person who doesn't use haptic feedback so it didn't affect me much.",4.0 out of 5 stars

  It was my 1st oneplus mobile and I am totally disappointed with the quality. The mobile screen was having 2 tiny black dots may be dead pixels when it got delivered to me 1st time. I have requested the replacement. To my surprise even the replaces Mobile set was also having 1 tiny black dot. I have uploaded pics of both the phones. Totally disappointed with oneplus mobile. I wish I could return it and get the refund. Pathetic experience.

  This is my third week of using 1plus nord CE. Phone is awesome in terms of performance. Camera quality is good but you need to use correct mode for motion pictures. Panorama pic quality is simply awesome. Only turn down factor is battery. It lasts hardly 12 hrs with average use of phone. Not yet tried any music app. Currenly using with 4g sim so I can not talk about 5g speed. If you are planning to buy I think better wait for Nord2 and take best out of the two.

  Been using this device since  past two weeks,The phone is quite slim and is handy to use,the camera is a bit disappointing at that price point,and the phone isn't having dual stereo speakers but the voice is quite loud,was disappointed that the phone didn't have the OG ALERT SLIDER (COST CUTTINGS), but,the UI i.e Oxygen OS is one point didn't feel a lag till now and didn't feel much difference compared to the flagships(I also use a OnePlus 8)...The conclusion I would like to give is if you don't care much about camera and price, can go for it,or else there are many other phones In the market with a bit better features than this at much lower or similar price,but you can't get such amazing user experience on any other phone.

  Excellent mobile in the given cost range. Waited patiently for the Silver Ray colour. Looks stunning and ultra light and superfast. Overall satisfied with product. Only downside is its front camera as its below average. Battery is lasting for me about a day after heavy mobile usage. So all claimining about fast battery draining is not true. Dont believe in negative comments. I have been using One Plus for more than 4 years. It will never disappoint you. Considering the costing One Plus has managed a great deal. U get One Plus experience, fast charging, lag free device, superb rear camera and ultra light mobile and if thats not all u will keep on getting updates for next two years and security support for 1 year after that. This is an awesome deal considering all the parameters.

  This review comes after almost a month of use. So far uptill now it's normal and nothing great in this phone. Secondly I am unable to understand why OnePlus is constantly releasing new models every other month. There seems to be constant effort to improve the devices. Thirdly I agree with reviews that 25k for this device is very expensive.i will give it 7 out of 10 overall and surely not a good buy if they are releasing improvements every month.

  Call recording feature is disgusting , no auto recording system and when you record the conversation an automated voice starts that your recording has begun. Disgusting. Some other features are disgusting too. As per the price of the phone I do not find it useful. One plus nord or nord ce5 are degraded version of one plus. Not upto the mark , one plus 5, 6 ,7 etc are best but one plus nord series are the worst.

  One plus nord CE has big time network issues. Purchased on 20.06.2021. I am not able to do or recieve calls. I have to restart all the time. My wifi speed is of 250 MBps. Still not able to do any whatsapp call. I tried reset the network, wifi and bluetooth. But of no use. I am using two recently changed new SIM cards. I have restart all the time to place a call. This is too frustrating. Please fo not buy this phone. I am trying return it but I can see only replace option as of now.

  Not a good experience overall after use of 4days. Camera quality is so poor. 64 MP back camera works like a 8 MP or 16 MP. Heating issue is another concerning point. If you use it for video call or gaming the phone is heated up quickly. This version of one+ is just defaming one+ or you can say the deterioration of one+ started. This is my first experience of any one+ and earlier I heard that one+ is like Apple for those who is really concerned about budget. But this experience of one+ really disappointed me.

  Please buy this product only if you wish to have a phone under the brand name of ""One plus"" or else it's not worth it. The camera are not good at all it's below average and front camera is just pathetic. However having a phone of 8gb ram and 128 gb storage is not that bad at this price that too under brand name of ONE PLUS but please don't expect much out of it. Apart from this the fingerprint sensor is just pathetic.it never works when you try to unlock an application using fingerprint

  I have been using many of the OnePlus mobile's now , that's the reason I took the mobile without a doubt but the mobile is waste of money . The camera is so pathetic. Even the mobiles which cost less than 8k take good pictures and ofcourse the quality of the front camera is even worse . So if you are a person who use it for video calling or taking pictures this mobile is definitely not for you. Despite its a new mobile it heats up a lot. Over all its the worst mobile one plus has ever manufactured

  This is my first One Plus phone and I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with the Phone. All those who listen to Music on the Run, will be disappointed with the buggy software on the Phone. When you are listening to Music on your Bike or Jogging, and you pause it in between and then try to play it again, it doesn't resume back. Tried various workarounds to solve it, yet no resolution on this issue. I have a Moto G 5G Phone which works amazing on this aspect and other things. Even the Camera is not upto the mark though they boast of it being 64MP. Battery life is average. The look and the form factor is the only good thing, but the internal stuff sucks. Buggy One Plus...Waste of money, check for other options and stay away from this phone..

  The phone is a compact beast. There are no heating issues even while using the phone on plugging it to the Warp charger. Very fast charging. In almost an hour 100% is done. Good battery backup specially if you use it in the auto dimming mode. Feather touch. Display is big enough and slim. The phone is made of plastic...to some it may look cheap but trust me you would hate heavier phones in you trousers after using this. The camera is not bad either. Quality of photos are as good as Redmi Note 10. Yet the RAM and the Internal memory is the best you can get in this segment. Think something... Many of our phones have suffered lags due to heavy data in its system. One plus has given this issue foremost importance. A gamer would love this set due to its battery life.. good sensors and equally good performance. I bet you would not get any better at this price. This is a must buy. One Plus should gift me a Bluetooth smartwatch seeing its sales increase because of my review. Anyways thank you one plus. I have a beast in my pocket now.

  I have started using the phone since 24th June and transferred all apps only on 25th. The phone lags and hangs and sends ""xyz app is not responding"" at least once every hour or so. The camera is fantastic, agreed. But everything else about is just sad. Has a face recognition unlock feature, it hasn't worked once. For all the hype, this is not a great phone at all. Please do not opt for it. Maybe the higher models are good but if you don't have the budget for them, maybe just stick to brands like Mi. At least you won't feel cheated at that price point.

However, the phone feels good in hand. The colour is nice and the weight is less.

  Nord ce is a good phone, phone charges 0 to 100 in nearly 1 hour, camera is good not bad, with normal usage for me battery last about 2 to 3 days (i reduced refresh rate of display to 60hz and i dont play games and use social apps normal), mobile back side looks like premium, but the back cover which we get with mobile hides the premium look of back side, we should purchase fully transparent back cover seperately, one drawback is external SD card storage is not available but you can use OTG, network speed is good, speaker is loud enough that you never have to use it on full volume ( in normal noisy area). I think people who used mid range mobiles like under 17000 this is good phone, but for people who used heavy mobiles like above 35000 i think this mobile wont suit them.Hope you get your answers.

  I love the Nord CE. I am happy with the product. Though it has been just 10 days since I got it, I am happy with the purchase. The camera is decent and battery lasts for an entire day depending on usage@4500mah. The phone is very smooth to use, it is light weight and slim which is very comfortable to hold. I have not done any gaming at all so can't comment on the graphics. The Nord CE has a single speaker at the bottom right which is pretty loud. The fast warp charging charges the mobile from 16%-100% in less than one and a half hours. It does not have a expandable memory though. I guess the 128GB in-built should be sufficient but a slot would have been great.

  It's been 3 days since I'm using the phone and it is buttery smooth! The battery is excellent too which charges really quickly and gives you more than 1 day of usage even with medium to heavy usage. The cameras are a great improvement since Nord and they remove natural color images. Even the nightscape mode is a blessing which removes shots under low light with pretty good clarity almost as close to a Pixel 4a if not there. Yes I've compared both the phones since I have both of them. The 90hz refresh rate makes the experience even more smooth and quick along with the beautiful display. Totally recommend this under 27k! I don't get why there's so much hate about this phone, I think OnePlus did a great job except the Alert slider which was missing and the Gorilla Glass protection.

Device is excellent in terms of smoothness & functionality coz of oxygen os & a good battery life with fast charging.also hosts a no of good OnePlus features for daily usage. Had it been under 20k it would be the best bang for the buck. Overall a great phone for moderate/ regular users with good android software & security updates !!",5.0 out of 5 stars

  Better buy a samsung M51 than this one. Purchased with phone as my secondary phone but not happy with even the normal performance, camera and display are like 5K to 10K phones. Feels and looks like a teal plastic brick.

"
  I had really high hopes for this product. I m a 2 year user of galaxy s9 so I was looking to upgrade my phone. I went for the 12gb ram model. Simply put it does not have the juice to warrant a 27k price tag. I found the UI clunky and slow. There were performance lags at places where a 12gb phone had no place belonging. The display was weirdly grainy on fine edges. I don't know how that's possible on such a high res screen.

  Before launch of this phone I got update in one plus 6, after which my phone battery is draining from 100 to 0 in less then 2 hours. Games are hanging and lagging, camera quality & focus became very poor. Oneplus is downgrading old phones so customers buy new ones. At the price of this nord one can get better phones of other companies, this phone have plastic body & no glass back, it failed durability test, average camera quality it is just downgraded version of previous oneplus nord. I will not buy oneplus again, I want to switch to other brand.

  Amazing product in  2 words. the OnePlus is famous for the os , the Oxygen os is much better than any other silly phone's. Camera is good, people's are saw many review's and comparison on YouTube, please don't go with that silly people's, for gaming I played both COD and BGMI 45 mins, and I did not feel any lag,frame drop and heating issue,and I play with high graphics on High ,for high ultra is not available, and there customisation are very good , seriously one Plus know how to make good phone's, in Between game I have some office work so I just went to laptop by resuming the game and come after 20min ,trust me I were still in lobby after 20min with 4 apps open in background,there Ram management is very good, please don't go with the reviews on YouTube with iqoo,lqoo,pqoo,chuqoo,,😂 , don't go with the slightly speed comparison with those shitty name phone's, obviously man Mercedes has less mileage than swift desire, but the name is enough, go with the brand ,I. Know both are Chinese so why choose pure Chinese 😂 lol , go with OnePlus and experience the OnePlus os and there optimization, trust me they know how to make good phone's...,...

  The phone is FINE. Considering the well deserved criticisation cum hate OnePlus has gathered recently, this phone missing the alert slider is okay. The display is beautiful, the cameras as trust me good, with 90Hz, even the battery performs well, if they say about charging time, I've compared with 33 W poco m2 pro charging, both phones charge from 0 to 100 in just the same time : approx 50 mins. Software experience needs not to be talked about, best in segment. Missing pieces in the art are glass back but I don't mind that for the fact that now it's less prone to damage, mono speakers are a bit let down, ois could have made cameras just better that nord, fingerprint is a bit issue while being used under a tempered glass as it becomes less responsive even after being less responsive already. In the day to day use, the phone just flies, preforms really well and consistent, plays pubg pretty lag free, haptic feedback is good enough to play it's role in the segment. This is a 5 day extensive use review.

  The things that you really gonna miss in your daily life from this oneplus are fast processing, an alert slider and due to ufs 2.1 the file transfer speed can be a lil more time consuming but xcept that it is really agreat deal in 23k. Camera quality could have been better for sure but the lack of OIS shows how much it is important, but this phone isn't made for rigorous gamers neither for the one who are looking to use it as a primary device for photography go for it if u r a normal user, the fingerprint is bttr thn average and battery life n UI is a big plus point for this phone but a plastic back at this plus point is really a disgrace.

  Phone was bought on June 30th. There was a system update yesterday (7th July) and it was installed. Today morning it was found that the phone was stuck in re-ebooting stage (with one plus logo ) and had heated up.(Auto power ON/OFF is set for night) Pressing the power ON button did not help as it did not respond. After a while pressing the power ON and Volume UP button set it to restart and now it has booted up properly. Don't know how it will behave in the coming days. I consider this a major problem because over heating of the phone, when it's stuck at bootup, can damage it. Another problem is with sending contact cards through mms/sms. Won't get transferred. Dark mode is greyish when comapred with other phones and it switches back to normal mode automatically.

  The device is super smooth and in fact, I am typing this from the Nord CE. Would recommend it as at this price point I don't think anyone would offer better than this. The camera is amazing and does not make the pictures look unreal. I have got 113 GB as usable storage. Network connectivity is awesome. Everything comes with a negative point so here the OnePlus Nord CE no different: the only issue I have faced is while calling. The sensor which turns off the screen seems not to be working really well for me. It switches on the screen and ends up muting the call, putting it on speaker. So yeah that's pretty much. Conclusion: great phone, would recommend

  Writing a review after a month of using it; This phone is just decent, not exceptional but not bad either. Has some major heating issues (lags while heavy gaming), decent camera and processor.

  i think in this price range this is best phone with feeling of oxygen OS. i would say there is a better battery life for moderate usage, produces a  great picture capability for landscapes and nature photography,like to say having a good photography results in outdoor conditions, all cameras does decent job. like to say yes there is a very average quality in indoor light conditions.",5.0 out of 5 stars

  I have bought it for my DAD as he is basic user so it is best due to its smoothness of software, finger print reader is accurate and after update battery life is much better.

  I was using Realme 2 and I moved into One plus Nord CE. It's my first One plus device and I must say it's smooth, premium, has a great software experience and a nice feel in hand. I will definitely recommend to anyone who's going with a budget of 25K . Many are saying it's not that great when compared to the original series but the fact is based on the price and the brand value I can assure you that just go for this , it won't disappoint you

  All the negative review posters, please get pragmatic. At the price offered, this certainly is a good phone. Nevertheless, the alert slider and a better performance in terms of low light photography is something oneplus should not have omitted, but the OS performance, the premium look, the reduced weight, the aux port and the great display, kind of makes up for the loss. It's a thumbs up from my end.

  OS out of the box was not stable. Received 11.0.3.3 update during initial setup. Seems lot better after updating. Camera is average. Phone could have been priced starting under 20k.

  Ordered the phone on OnePlus website on the first day of sale june 16th 2021. Got the parcel yesterday ie on 19th june. The delivery was quick, but phone looks like old refurbished piece. I can see the gumming of the screen and gap at the edges. I don’t understand how come they send these type cheap Quality product on the first sale of product itself. Lost the respect on OnePlus product. I am using OnePlus since 4years and never got native impression. I ordered the phone for my mom now and that was dissatisfaction. 💔

  Look guys believe me there are phones better than this in this price range and I know that . But they excel in only few things . For example poco x 3 pro which has far superior processor but lacks amoled 5 g etc. There's Xiaomi but you lack the software advantage and the smoothness that nord ce has . I have searched for phones in this price range and I have been waiting for a month checking reviews looking for other alternatives etc but at this price point this is the only phone which does everything. Yes you can have a better gaming phone but it is good only for playing games not for daily usage or taking pics. Yes you can have better camera than this but you cant get the amount of performance this phone does. The thing is this is an all-rounder . You cant compare it with the note 10 series or samsung which are camera centric and lack the speed. You cant compare it with poco or iqoo which lack oxygen os and better displays or better design . So I would say for a normal ordinary person who goes to college ( mbbs like me ) or who goes to work or has a job  etc this is the phone to buy. But if you are a professional gamer or a professional photographer you could consider buying a flagship.Bottom line this is",5.0 out of 5 stars

  Bought it yesterday but from very first day it's battery drains too fast. In 30 minutes it goes down by 20%. The reason why I bought this phone because my previous phone' battery was not good, nord also not making any difference, battery wise.

  I don't know why people criticized this phone. It is Packed with numerous features and awesome performance.  camera is of god level. Fast 90hz refresh rate makes the overall tasks so smooth and easy. I don't why the youtubers who review gadgets gave such bad response for ths device. For me this is just a great phone at this price segment. I am using it since 2 weeks. Sharing some pictures sample taken by this oneplus nord ce.

  This is my first OnePlus and I got this after a long wait. Have been using this mobile almost a month now and below is my review",4.0 out of 5 stars
"
  I bought this phone 2 weeks back. Overall this is an average phone. Battery life is good, it could better. The phone's build quality is OK. Its back camera is average, when you zoom the picture it gets distorted. Its front camera is pathetic, pictures from the front camera are really pathetic, it puts lots of extra marks on the face. During video calls as well picture quality is very bad. Oneplus must release its fix soon, in the current state its front camera is not usable at all.

  The OnePlus experience is superb, before this I had a Redmi device which is full of bugs and bloatwares but after using the Nord CE I am having the best experience, the UI, camera, display quality everything is just top notch. Yes it is a different thing that the mobile is a bit costly than it's competitors but the UI experience you get in OnePlus is supreme and those extra bucks are worth it. It would have been great if this device had the OnePlus signature feature of alertslider that's the only drawback I feel but everything else is just supreme!!! I will say go for it and don't fall under pressure of other people saying it is costly other phones are cheaper and have good specification, but this phone will provide you quality which is important and try to get the blue void color it just looks really really great 😍💯",5.0 out of 5 stars

  Worst mobile I hv seen in my life. Replaced once and still getting the mobile with lot of software issues. Never dare to buy. U will regret.and what I feel Amazon is good for grocery and dresses not for electronic items.

  The phone is above average but with pros and cons considering the 23000/- variant rest all are overpriced for me. Value for money is only base variant with bank discount ie around 22000/-",3.0 out of 5 stars

  Waste. They are just changing the  brand name and selling. Thats it. Everything else seems to be so unsatisfactory from inside.

  Fluid Amoled display with 90hz refresh rate & oxygen OS along with SD 750G processor makes a perfect phone to use. Very sturdy build quality. Surprisingly phone is very very light eventhough housing a 4500mah battery.",5.0 out of 5 stars
